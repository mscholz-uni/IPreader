--------------------------------------
11.12.2021 version 1.5
-added: blue lines of the reference compound are displayed with intensities
-added: libtiffread-1.c stdev determined from scatter of pixels in image columns
-added: stdev saveable with every datapoint in dat format
-added: gamma for thumbnail is used: tif 0.01, gel 1.0, png 0.1
-fixed: error peakpicking if too many or too few peaks are picked
-fixed: error in peakpicking when trying to find closest peaks 
-changed: the y-scale is scaled by 2^bits => closer to counts
-changed: data export on raw
-added: information about differences in y-scale between tif and gel files; the latter use a sqrt compression
--------------------------------------
14.11.2021 version 1.4
-changed: the peak picked list also work now when only two peaks are picked
-added: detection gel files which are scanned the wrong way round
--------------------------------------
13.11.2021 version 1.3
-added: diamond and LaB6 reference data
-changed: peakpicking does not longer used smoothened diffractogram (-> Savitzky-Golay filter)
-note: reference data should be checked for Miller indeces once more
-changed: the peak picked list is used for a linear regression when more than two peaks are found
--------------------------------------
10.02.2021 version 1.2
-changed: only allow shifting of boxes along y but not along x
--------------------------------------
09.09.2017 version 1.1
-fixed: changed to work with the tk8.6-blt2.5 on ubuntu-16.04
        depends now on wish8.6
--------------------------------------
09.04.2015 version 1.0
-fixed: error when changing the reference compound
--------------------------------------
30.07.2014 version 0.9
-changed: stricter criterion for ruling out outliers in the peak assignment routine
          => more robust with noisy and artifact rich reference diffractograms
--------------------------------------
14.05.2014 version 0.8
-added: export of linear regression results upon calibrating 2theta with a reference compound
-changed: require tcltk-8.5; necessary because of BLT-2.5 which only works under tcltk8.5
-added: filename is reported in window title
--------------------------------------
01.04.2014 version 0.7
-changed: algorithm for peak picking: uses Savitzky-Golay filter and interpolates with 2nd order polynomial interpolation
-changed: algorithm to calculate 2theta scales; kicks out (some) unwanted background reflexes,
          kicks out values 5*stddev  and tries out the 4 most intensive peaks
--------------------------------------
25.03.2014 version 0.6
-fixed: unbalanced braces upon taking trace on diffractogram with saturated points.
--------------------------------------
17.03.2014 version 0.5
-fixed: take on tiff-file triggered error message "....tmp...."
-fixed: error in peak pick; more robust now finds almost all peaks
-added: linear regression to determine scaleA and scaleB
-fixed: in "proc peak picking" index bigger than allowed
-added: error message when trying to extract traces with saturated points
--------------------------------------
09.02.2014 version 0.4
-updated: extended lists of reflexes for reference compounds
--------------------------------------
09.02.2014 version 0.3
-added: export to STOE raw file
--------------------------------------
03.02.2014 version 0.2:
-fixed: read several images one after another
-changed: save pattern with arbitrary filename
-fixed: access to non-existent list values while averaging in peakpick
-added: export GNUPLOT or XY (GNUPLOT = XY - header of hashed comments)
-added: average over all y-values
--------------------------------------
13.12.2013 version 0.1
